# How To Use : Functions:
# Math.add([]);
Adds an infinite amount of numbers together. to use type Math.add([]) "MUST HAVE [ AND ]" in the [ and ] type a number followed by a comma followed by a number foll- You get the point. It will add all the numbers together.Ex. Math.add([3,3,3,4]) Will Return 13.
# Math.sub([]);
Subtration Same, BUT SUBTRACTS FROM LEFT - RIGHT.
# Math.mult;
Multiplacation Multiplys all the numbers.From L - R.
# Math.div;
division Using the l - r rule.
# Math.m([x],m);
All modes above in one. x = an array for the equasion so for example in Math.add it would be Math.add([2,2]); Would return 4; M = The Mode, Type "M" for Multiplacation, Type "S" for subtraction, Type "D" for division, Type "A" for Addition (Also MUST have quotes) ex Math.m([2,2],"A").    
# Math.VmRm(x);
Its Simple Type The Equasion In the "()" for ex. Math.VmRm(2+4); Will Return 6; Operators: - for subtraction + for addition / for division * for multiplacation.
# Math.count(s,f,e,m).
S is the starting number F is the finishing number e is the element to add the output to m is the line mode true = add line breaks for numbers false = no line break but a space insted.
# Math.cRandom(m,g,e,r,a).
m=Multiplyer Of Numbers. G = From 0 - G Range to generate. E = Element to Post data to r = round options U for up D for down A = line break's true Or false.
# Math.circle(r,sc,lw,fc);
r = raidus, sc = outter line stroke color, lw = outter line width, fc = fill color of circle.
# Math.square(h,w,fc);
h = height, w = width, fc = fill color.
# Math.tri(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,lw,ch,cw,lc,fc);
So A long one. x1 y1 = the x,y cords for the first point of the triangle.x2 y2 = the x,y cords for the second point of the triangle.x3 y3 = the x,y cords for the third point of the triangle point of the triangle; this point will auto connect to the first point. lw = line width. ch = canvas height (There is no reasonable way to calculate it) cw = canvas width (again no real way to get it). lc = line color. fc = fill color.
# Math.octo(n,s,lw,lc,fc);
n = number of sides 1 does nothing. s = size. lw = line width. lc = line color. fc = fill color.
