How To Use / Functions:		
Functions:		
Math.add([]); Adds an infinite amount of numbers together. to use type Math.add([]) "MUST HAVE [ AND ]" in the [ and ] type a number followed by a comma followed by a number foll- You get the point. It will add all the numbers together.Ex. Math.add([3,3]) Will Return 6.
Math.sub([]); Subtration Same, BUT SUBTRACTS FROM LEFT - RIGHT.
Math.mult; Multiplacation Multiplys all the numbers.From L - R.
Math.div; division Using the l - r rule.
Math.m([x],m); All modes above in one. x = an array for the equasion so for example in Math.add it would be Math.add([2,2]); Would return 4; M = The Mode, Type "M" for Multiplacation, Type "S" for subtraction, Type "D" for division, Type "A" for Addition (Also MUST have quotes) ex Math.m([2,2],"A").    
Math.VmRm(x); Its Simple Type The Equasion In the "()" for ex. Math.VmRm(2+4); Will Return 6; Operators: - for subtraction + for addition / for division * for multiplacation.
Math.count(s,f,e,m). S is the starting number F is the finishing number e is the element to add the output to m is the line mode true = add line breaks for numbers false = no line break but a space insted.
Math.cRandom(m,g,e,r,a). m=Multiplyer Of Numbers. G = From 0 - G Range to generate. E = Element to Post data to r = round options U for up D for down A = line break's true Or false.
